<@erochester> the value that the attr_type line in the output has is the geometry type that'll be missing from GEOM_TYPE, if my theory is right

geoserver, sounds fine. i suspect it may not have anything to do with SLDs, however. if you want to try something else, have it dump out geometries so you can see which columns it thinks contains geometry data, and then try to figure out which column in the postgres table actually contains the geometry data. may need to change how the script identifies that column

you may also want to bump up the memory for your vm. your workstation may be pretty limited on that, though, so it may make more sense for you to install geoserver directly on your machine, and just run postgis in the vm

ok, if I do a dump on the geometries I can just cat to it

I think geoserver is actually already installed, but I'm not sure exactly how to get into that same environment as the vm terminal or the geoserver web gui for that matter.

but then how exactly would I test the script through the script dialog box with http requests is what I'm wondering....
